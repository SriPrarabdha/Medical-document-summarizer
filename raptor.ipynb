Neurophysiologic testing is intended to clarify this clinical suspicion and differentiate spinal nerve root lesion from peripheral nerve lesion. Abnormal NCV & EMG correlate with less favorable prognosis of recovery and are helpful in further clinical management. If there is diffuse denervation, prognosis of functional recovery is unfavorable. But if there are no signs of denervation, the prognosis is more favorable.\\nNerve Conduction Studies\\nMotor Summary Table\\nLeft Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 5.2 28.0 54 >50.0\\nElbow 9.1 7.5 >5.0\\nRight Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 4.7 28.0 60 >50.0\\nElbow 8.6 8.7 >5.0\\nLeft Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 2.8 <4.2 9.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.9 26.0 53 >53.0\\nElbow 7.7 9.4 >3.0\\nRight Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 3.0 <4.2 7.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.2 26.0 62 >53.0\\nElbow 7.2 4.8 >3.0\\nSensory Summary Table\\nLeft DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 13.1 >10.0 Wrist Dorsum 5th MC 2.0 12.0 60 >45.0\\nRight DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist <2.7 12.0 >45.0\\nLeft Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.2 <3.6 38.1 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 3.3 14.0 42 >39.0\\nPalm 2.1 33.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 0.9 7.0 78\\nWrist 2nd Digit 2.4 7.0 29\\nPalm 2nd Digit 3.6 14.0 39\\nRight Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.6 <3.6 30.0 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 1.4 7.0 50 >39.0\\nPalm 2.3 21.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 2.2 7.0 32\\nWrist Palm\\nLeft Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <2.7 20.1 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.1 10.0 48 >45.0\\nRight Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 15.5 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.0 10.0 50 >45.0\\nLeft Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <3.7 27.1 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 2.5 14.0 56 >45.0\\nRight Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.6 <3.7 28.6 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 0.9 14.0 156 >45.0\\nF Wave Studies\\nECN: 20240220989\\nReceived Date: 2024-02-19\", '21': 'Patient: BROWN, KEVIN\\nTest Date: 1/19/2024\\nPage 2\\nNR\\nLeft Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nRight Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nLeft Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nRight Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nEMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Amp Dur Poly Recrt Int Pat Comment\\nRight Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nParaspinal EMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Comment\\nRight C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nRight C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 0\\nFINDINGS: Evaluation of the Left dorsal cutaneous sensory, the Left median (digit 2) sensory, the Right median (digit 2) sensory, the Left radial sensory, and the Right radial sensory nerves showed prolonged distal peak latency (L2.9, L4.2, R4.6, L3.3, R2.9 ms).

Medical treatment for the patient consist of analgesics. The patient was advised to see a Chiropractor and an acupuncturist, advised to attend physical therapy program at a frequency of 4 times per week for the first four weeks, until next evaluation. Physical therapy will consist of various modalities such as thermo therapy (Hot/Cold Pack), electrotherapy and electric stimulation, cervical traction manipulation therapy, assisted active and passive range of motion exercises for injured areas. Additional treatment protocol was outlined with the patient being instructed for specific every day home exercise additional therapeutic equipment such as has been prescribed for patient's home use to support treatment. The patient agreed to therapy plan proposed as recommended. On the basis of medical history presented by the patient and the physical examination findings, it is in my opinion to reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the condition described above is related to the above-mentioned incident. Patient will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks.

increasing circulation to the affected areas through process of photobiomodulation. Multiple studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals on its use in reducing pain, healing chronic wounds and restoring protective sensation. I believe the patient's condition will benefit from use of this laser therapy at home because of musculoskeletal injury treatment and find it medically necessary to control pain, and increase local blood circulation that will assist in rehabilitation. The modality of treatment is cost-effective and appropriate since the patient's symptoms have not improved with other listed interventions. Since this device may be used at home, the patient will be better able to comply with their treatment regimen. The patient will remain in my care while using this device. \\nLumbar Spine\\nPHYSICIAN'S INFORMATION:\\nPhysician Print Name: Jean Pierre Barakat\\nPhysician Address: 6269 99th Street\\nCity: Rego Park State: NY Zip Code: 11374 Phone: 347-578-875\\nNPI #:\\nPhysician's Signature:\\nLicense #:\\nDate: 11/14/22\\nNOTE: Please include all the appropriate Medical Notes with the Prescription \\nECN: 202401020914 Received Date: 2023-12-27 \\n\", '67': \"Far Rockaway Medical PC\\n62-69 99th Street, Rego Park, NY 11374 Email: Nyregoparkmedical@gmail.com\\nPatient's Name: Kiwi brown\\nD.O.A. 10/13/23 Date: 11/14/23\\nPOSITIONING CUSHION\\nINFRA RED LAMP\\nGENERAL USE CUSHION (wide)\\nLUMBER SACRAL SUPPORT\\nDEEP TISSUE MASSAGER\\nEMS UNIT FOUR LEAD\\nT.E.N.S.

The patient currently rates the pain as 7-8/10. I will perform first lumbar epidural steroid injection as previously planned. No opioids were given for performance of this procedure. Written informed consent was obtained.\\nThe patient was placed in a prone position prepped and draped using meticulous sterile technique. Using fluoroscopic guidance, L4-L5 interspace was identified. Corresponding skin site was marked, 3cc of 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin and subcutaneous tissues using a 25-gauge needle. A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was then advanced using loss of resistance to air technique.\\nOnce encountered, negative aspiration for blood/CSF was performed.

Hopefully, this is transient radiculitis for the most part, he did well with disc decompression. Hopefully, the patient will do better with an epidural injection. If he fails to improve, consideration for possibility of disc re-herniation and new MRI of the lumbar spine may be considered. For now, we will monitor his progress.\\n2.

The patient currently rates the pain as 8/10. I will perform second lumbar epidural steroid injection as previously planned. No opioids were given for performance of this procedure. Written informed consent was obtained.\\nThe patient was placed in a prone position prepped and draped using meticulous sterile technique. Using fluoroscopic guidance, L5-S1 interspace was identified. Corresponding skin site was marked, 3cc of 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetizes the skin and subcutaneous tissues using a 25-gauge needle. A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was then advanced using loss of resistance to air technique.\\nOnce encountered, negative aspiration for blood/CSF was performed. No paresthesia was elicited. 1.6cc of Omnipaque 240 revealed good epidural spread followed by 80mg of Kenalog with 3cc of normal saline and 1cc of 1% Lidocaine was administered epidurally. Needle was withdrawn. Sterile Band-Aid was applied.\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.

Emergency crew did not arrive at the scene of the accident. The patient was not brought to the emergency room. The patient had no medical issues before the accident, as he stated. Past/Family medical history: the patient denies any significant past medical history.\\nSUBJECTIVE COMPLAINTS: The patient reports stiffness and constant aching neck pain (6/10). The patient has difficulties turning the head. The pain exacerbates with increased activity. The patient has stiffness and aching pain in the middle back (6/10). The pain exacerbates by performing house activities, prolonged sitting. The patient also reports constant aching pain in the lower back (7/10). The pain exacerbates by prolonged sitting and standing, bending down.\\nMEDICAL NECESSITY: This report will additionally serve as medical necessity for providing ultrasound testing. A diagnostic ultrasonographic examination was performed in order to help confirm the severity of soft tissue nerve injury and quantify the possibility of a patient’s concomitant neurophysiological status. \\nBenefits of ultrasound:\\n• Dynamic imaging: ultrasound evaluation can be directly guided by the patient’s symptoms and findings at physical examination. This study is concentrated on the area of the concern of the patient, areas of tenderness and focal symptoms with feedback from the patient during exam. Doctors can diagnose “in real time” as they can see movement of a soft tissue structure such as tendon, joint or an extremity.\\n• Sensitivity: ultrasound is priceless in the assessing of the conditions, such as partial or full-thickness tears of muscles or ligaments, hemorrhages, snap tendon syndromes, bone injury’s, infections, blood accumulations, cellulitis, detection of soft tissue masses, ganglion cysts, soft tissues tumors. According to a Mayo clinic study, ultrasound appeared to be more sensitive than MRI in detecting injuries in the inflammation of certain structures as well as stages of healing: from active inflammation to resolved condition, such as resolved stage of healing fibrosis.\\n• Availability: widely available, easy-to-use and less expensive than most other imaging methods.\\n• Safety: extremely safe, non-invasive and does not use radiation, excellent alternative for claustrophobic patients and patients with cardiac pacemakers or metallic implants.

Phys:\\nMEDICAL NECESSITY: The patient's symptoms and neurological signs raise the possibility of the peripheral nervous system (nerve root, peripheral nerve) injury (irritation, compression, stretching). Neurophysiologic testing is intended to clarify this clinical suspicion and differentiate spinal nerve root lesion from peripheral nerve lesion. Abnormal NCV & EMG correlate with less favorable prognosis of recovery and are helpful in further clinical management. If there is diffuse denervation, prognosis of functional recovery is unfavorable. But if there are no signs of denervation, the prognosis is more favorable.\\nNerve Conduction Studies\\nMotor Summary Table\\nLeft Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 5.2 28.0 54 >50.0\\nElbow 9.1 7.5 >5.0\\nRight Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 4.7 28.0 60 >50.0\\nElbow 8.6 8.7 >5.0\\nLeft Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 2.8 <4.2 9.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.9 26.0 53 >53.0\\nElbow 7.7 9.4 >3.0\\nRight Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 3.0 <4.2 7.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.2 26.0 62 >53.0\\nElbow 7.2 4.8 >3.0\\nSensory Summary Table\\nLeft DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 13.1 >10.0 Wrist Dorsum 5th MC 2.0 12.0 60 >45.0\\nRight DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist <2.7 12.0 >45.0\\nLeft Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.2 <3.6 38.1 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 3.3 14.0 42 >39.0\\nPalm 2.1 33.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 0.9 7.0 78\\nWrist 2nd Digit 2.4 7.0 29\\nPalm 2nd Digit 3.6 14.0 39\\nRight Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.6 <3.6 30.0 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 1.4 7.0 50 >39.0\\nPalm 2.3 21.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 2.2 7.0 32\\nWrist Palm\\nLeft Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <2.7 20.1 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.1 10.0 48 >45.0\\nRight Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 15.5 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.0 10.0 50 >45.0\\nLeft Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <3.7 27.1 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 2.5 14.0 56 >45.0\\nRight Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.6 <3.7 28.6 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 0.9 14.0 156 >45.0\\nF Wave Studies\\nECN: 20240220989\\nReceived Date: 2024-02-19Patient: BROWN, KEVIN\\nTest Date: 1/19/2024\\nPage 2\\nNR\\nLeft Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nRight Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nLeft Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nRight Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nEMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Amp Dur Poly Recrt Int Pat Comment\\nRight Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nParaspinal EMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Comment\\nRight C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nRight C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 0\\nFINDINGS: Evaluation of the Left dorsal cutaneous sensory, the Left median (digit 2) sensory, the Right median (digit 2) sensory, the Left radial sensory, and the Right radial sensory nerves showed prolonged distal peak latency (L2.9, L4.2, R4.6, L3.3, R2.9 ms). The Right dorsal cutaneous sensory nerve showed no response (Wrist). All remaining nerves (as indicated in the following tables) were within normal limits.\\nAll F Wave latencies were within normal limits.\\nAll examined muscles (as indicated in the following table) showed no evidence of electrical instability.\\nIMPRESSIONS: The above electrodiagnostic study reveals evidence of right C5 - C6 and left C3 - C4 radiculopathies. Also, the electrodiagnostic study reveals evidence of a bilateral sensory median nerve neuropathy at the wrist. This is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In addition, the electrodiagnostic study reveals evidence sensory peripheral neuropathy affecting the upper extremities.\\nOMAR AHMED, MD\\nMATTHEW JORDAN, PA\\nWaveforms:\\nECN: 2024022002989\\nReceived Date: 2024-02-19Patient: BROWN, KEVIN\\nTest Date: 1/19/2024\\nPage 3\\nNCV [Left Median Motor]\\nWrist:\\nElbow:\\n10000 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nNCV [Right Median Motor]\\nWrist:\\nElbow:\\n10000 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nNCV [Left Ulnar Motor]\\nWrist:\\nElbow:\\n10000 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nNCV [Right Ulnar Motor]\\nWrist:\\nElbow:\\n10000 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nNCV [Right Ulnar Motor]\\nWrist:\\nElbow:\\n5000 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nNCV [Left DorsCutan Sensory]\\nWrist:\\nElbow:\\n20 µV/Div\\n2 ms/Div\\nNCV [Right DorsCutan Sensory]\\nWrist:\\n5000 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nNCV [Left Median D2 Sensory]\\nWrist:\\nPalm:\\n20 µV/Div\\n2 ms/Div\\nNCV [Right Median D2 Sensory]\\nWrist:\\nPalm:\\n20 µV/Div\\n2 ms/Div\\nNCV [Left Radial Sensory]\\nWrist:\\n20 µV/Div\\n2 ms/Div\\nECN: 2024022002989\\nReceived Date: 2024-02-19 \\nPatient: BROWN, KEVIN\\nTest Date: 1/19/2024\\nPage 4\\nNCV [Right Radial Sensory]\\nWrist:\\nNCV [Left Ulnar Sensory]\\nWrist:\\nNCV [Right Ulnar Sensory]\\nWrist:\\n20 µV/Div\\n2 ms/Div\\n20 µV/Div\\n2 ms/Div\\n20 µV/Div\\n2 ms/Div\\nF-Wave [Right Median (Mrks)]\\nTr 1\\nTr 2\\nTr 3\\nTr 4\\nTr 5\\nTr 6\\nTr 7\\nTr 8\\nF-Wave [Left Ulnar (Mrks)]\\nTr 1\\nTr 2\\nTr 3\\nTr 4\\nTr 5\\nTr 6\\nTr 7\\nTr 8\\nF-Wave [Right Ulnar (Mrks)]\\nTr 1\\nTr 2\\nTr 3\\nTr 4\\nTr 5\\nTr 6\\nTr 7\\nTr 8\\n5000 µV/Div\\n500 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\n5000 µV/Div\\n500 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\n5000 µV/Div\\n500 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nF-Wave [Left Median (Mrks)]\\n5000 µV/Div\\n500 µV/Div\\n5 ms/Div\\nECN: 2024022002989\\nReceived Date: 2024-02-19\", \"Farrockaway Medical PC \\n62-69 99th St\\nRego Park, NY 11374\\nmyregoparkmedical@gmail.com\\nINITIAL EXAMINATION REPORT\\nDate: 10/16/23 D.O.A: 10/13/23\\nMr. Kevin Brown is a 36 year old M who was involved in an accident. the details of the accident have been discussed with the patient.

Medical treatment for the patient consist of analgesics. The patient was advised to see a Chiropractor and an acupuncturist, advised to attend physical therapy program at a frequency of 4 times per week for the first four weeks, until next evaluation. Physical therapy will consist of various modalities such as thermo therapy (Hot/Cold Pack), electrotherapy and electric stimulation, cervical traction manipulation therapy, assisted active and passive range of motion exercises for injured areas. Additional treatment protocol was outlined with the patient being instructed for specific every day home exercise additional therapeutic equipment such as has been prescribed for patient's home use to support treatment. The patient agreed to therapy plan proposed as recommended. On the basis of medical history presented by the patient and the physical examination findings, it is in my opinion to reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the condition described above is related to the above-mentioned incident. Patient will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks. The possibility of this condition becoming permanent cannot be ruled out at this time because of the severity of the symptoms, the patient is somewhat limited in activities of daily living, as a result of the traumatic injury there were extreme of joint movement with concomitant stretching and tearing of the muscle/ligament structures. It appears that these areas may be permanently weakened for an indefinite period of time resulting in significant and permanent restricted mobility.

Information:\\nPatient Name: Kevin Brown\\nPatient Address: 67-23 Elliot Avenue\\nCity: Flushing State: NY Zip Code: 11379 Phone: 646 644 4417\\nDate Of Birth: 716187\\nPRODUCT: PAIN AWAY HOME CARE LASER DEVICE:\\nLaser Therapy is a recognized treatment that works by increasing circulation to the affected areas through process of photobiomodulation. Multiple studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals on its use in reducing pain, healing chronic wounds and restoring protective sensation. I believe the patient's condition will benefit from use of this laser therapy at home because of musculoskeletal injury treatment and find it medically necessary to control pain, and increase local blood circulation that will assist in rehabilitation. The modality of treatment is cost-effective and appropriate since the patient's symptoms have not improved with other listed interventions. Since this device may be used at home, the patient will be better able to comply with their treatment regimen. The patient will remain in my care while using this device. \\nLumbar Spine\\nPHYSICIAN'S INFORMATION:\\nPhysician Print Name: Jean Pierre Barakat\\nPhysician Address: 6269 99th Street\\nCity: Rego Park State: NY Zip Code: 11374 Phone: 347-578-875\\nNPI #:\\nPhysician's Signature:\\nLicense #:\\nDate: 11/14/22\\nNOTE: Please include all the appropriate Medical Notes with the Prescription \\nECN: 202401020914 Received Date: 2023-12-27 \\nFar Rockaway Medical PC\\n62-69 99th Street, Rego Park, NY 11374 Email: Nyregoparkmedical@gmail.com\\nPatient's Name: Kiwi brown\\nD.O.A. 10/13/23 Date: 11/14/23\\nPOSITIONING CUSHION\\nINFRA RED LAMP\\nGENERAL USE CUSHION (wide)\\nLUMBER SACRAL SUPPORT\\nDEEP TISSUE MASSAGER\\nEMS UNIT FOUR LEAD\\nT.E.N.S.

Radicular pattern of pain is mapped down in the right L5 nerve root distribution.\\nPower Testing: 5/5 for all extremities.\\nCervical Examination: Normal.\\nLumbar Examination: Moderate tenderness overlying the right lumbar facet of L3 through S1. SLR was positive on the right to 60 degrees. Lasegue sign was positive on the right.\\nDiagnostic Impression:\\n1. Lumbar radiculopathy (M54.16). Patient should undergo repeat lumbar epidural steroid injection (62323). If he fails to improve, we may consider obtaining new imaging studies. Hopefully, this is transient radiculitis for the most part, he did well with disc decompression. Hopefully, the patient will do better with an epidural injection. If he fails to improve, consideration for possibility of disc re-herniation and new MRI of the lumbar spine may be considered. For now, we will monitor his progress.\\n2. He may continue Motrin 600mg p.o. t.i.d. I have given him a prescription for Baclofen 10mg p.o. b.i.d., 40.\\nRespectfully Submitted,\\nSolomon Halioua, M.D.\\nThis has been electronically signed by Solomon Halioua, M.D. for visit dated 03-12-2024.\\nPage 1BROWN, KEVIN Male 07-06-1987\\nNew Horizon Surgical Center, L.L.C.\\n680 Broadway, Suite 201\\nPaterson, NJ 07514\\nTel:(973)782-4202 Fax:(973)782-4206\\nDATE: 03-15-2024\\nPATIENT: KEVIN BROWN\\nCHART NO: SCL11793\\nMRN: 71066\\nD.O.B: 07-06-1987\\nAGE: 36 year\\nRECORD OF OPERATION\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lumbar radiculopathy\\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lumbar radiculopathy\\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1.

The patient currently rates the pain as 8/10. I will perform second lumbar epidural steroid injection as previously planned. No opioids were given for performance of this procedure. Written informed consent was obtained.\\nThe patient was placed in a prone position prepped and draped using meticulous sterile technique. Using fluoroscopic guidance, L5-S1 interspace was identified. Corresponding skin site was marked, 3cc of 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetizes the skin and subcutaneous tissues using a 25-gauge needle. A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was then advanced using loss of resistance to air technique.\\nOnce encountered, negative aspiration for blood/CSF was performed. No paresthesia was elicited. 1.6cc of Omnipaque 240 revealed good epidural spread followed by 80mg of Kenalog with 3cc of normal saline and 1cc of 1% Lidocaine was administered epidurally. Needle was withdrawn. Sterile Band-Aid was applied.\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was discharged home after PACU discharge criteria were satisfied.\\nSolomon Halioua, M.D.\\nThis has been electronically signed on 03-15-2024.\\nPage 1NEW HORIZON SURGICAL CENTER\\nPatient Name (Last, First): Brown, Kevin\\nPhone # 908-446-4994\\nDate of service: 3/15/24\\nDate of Birth: 7/6/87\\nFUNDED\\nSELF PAY\\nCHARITY\\nCheck Amount:\\nNO-FAULT/PIP\\nState Policy Written: NY/OTHER\\nCase Open: YES NO\\nInsurance Company: Progressive\\nDOA: 12/3/23\\nClaim # 320338745\\nAddress: PO Box 3080\\nClinton, IN 52825\\nAdjuster Name:\\nPh:\\nExt:\\nAttorney Name:\\nPh:\\nAddress:\\nNOTES:\\nWORKERS COMPENSATION\\nState Policy Written: NY/NJ/OTHER\\nCase Open: YES NO\\nInsurance Company:\\nClaim#\\nDOA:\\nWCB#\\nAddress:\\nAdjuster Name:\\nPh:\\nExt:\\nAttorney Name:\\nPh:\\nAddress:\\nNOTES:\\nLIENS /LOPS\\nDOA:\\nAttorney\\'s Name:\\nDo we have signed LOP YES NO (attach if YES)\\nIs this case a slip and fall or MVA related?

Past/Family medical history: the patient denies any significant past medical history.\\nSUBJECTIVE COMPLAINTS: The patient reports stiffness and constant aching neck pain (6/10). The patient has difficulties turning the head. The pain exacerbates with increased activity. The patient has stiffness and aching pain in the middle back (6/10). The pain exacerbates by performing house activities, prolonged sitting. The patient also reports constant aching pain in the lower back (7/10). The pain exacerbates by prolonged sitting and standing, bending down.\\nMEDICAL NECESSITY: This report will additionally serve as medical necessity for providing ultrasound testing. A diagnostic ultrasonographic examination was performed in order to help confirm the severity of soft tissue nerve injury and quantify the possibility of a patient’s concomitant neurophysiological status. \\nBenefits of ultrasound:\\n• Dynamic imaging: ultrasound evaluation can be directly guided by the patient’s symptoms and findings at physical examination. This study is concentrated on the area of the concern of the patient, areas of tenderness and focal symptoms with feedback from the patient during exam. Doctors can diagnose “in real time” as they can see movement of a soft tissue structure such as tendon, joint or an extremity.\\n• Sensitivity: ultrasound is priceless in the assessing of the conditions, such as partial or full-thickness tears of muscles or ligaments, hemorrhages, snap tendon syndromes, bone injury’s, infections, blood accumulations, cellulitis, detection of soft tissue masses, ganglion cysts, soft tissues tumors. According to a Mayo clinic study, ultrasound appeared to be more sensitive than MRI in detecting injuries in the inflammation of certain structures as well as stages of healing: from active inflammation to resolved condition, such as resolved stage of healing fibrosis.\\n• Availability: widely available, easy-to-use and less expensive than most other imaging methods.\\n• Safety: extremely safe, non-invasive and does not use radiation, excellent alternative for claustrophobic patients and patients with cardiac pacemakers or metallic implants. Ultrasound has no known harmful effects on humans. \\nUltrasound is sophisticated, quick, and efficient diagnostic procedure not only for making exact diagnosis but also for establishing stage of healing which is helping in the modification of the treatment process in a timely manner.\\nTIME OF PROCEDURE: 30 minutes. \\nSKILLS OF THE DOCTOR: Procedure is performed and interpreted by Chiropractor duly licensed in the state of New York who specializes in the Diagnostic Sonography and has multiple certifications from Sonogram schools.

Phys:\\nMEDICAL NECESSITY: The patient's symptoms and neurological signs raise the possibility of the peripheral nervous system (nerve root, peripheral nerve) injury (irritation, compression, stretching). Neurophysiologic testing is intended to clarify this clinical suspicion and differentiate spinal nerve root lesion from peripheral nerve lesion. Abnormal NCV & EMG correlate with less favorable prognosis of recovery and are helpful in further clinical management. If there is diffuse denervation, prognosis of functional recovery is unfavorable. But if there are no signs of denervation, the prognosis is more favorable.\\nNerve Conduction Studies\\nMotor Summary Table\\nLeft Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 5.2 28.0 54 >50.0\\nElbow 9.1 7.5 >5.0\\nRight Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 4.7 28.0 60 >50.0\\nElbow 8.6 8.7 >5.0\\nLeft Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 2.8 <4.2 9.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.9 26.0 53 >53.0\\nElbow 7.7 9.4 >3.0\\nRight Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 3.0 <4.2 7.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.2 26.0 62 >53.0\\nElbow 7.2 4.8 >3.0\\nSensory Summary Table\\nLeft DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 13.1 >10.0 Wrist Dorsum 5th MC 2.0 12.0 60 >45.0\\nRight DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist <2.7 12.0 >45.0\\nLeft Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.2 <3.6 38.1 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 3.3 14.0 42 >39.0\\nPalm 2.1 33.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 0.9 7.0 78\\nWrist 2nd Digit 2.4 7.0 29\\nPalm 2nd Digit 3.6 14.0 39\\nRight Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.6 <3.6 30.0 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 1.4 7.0 50 >39.0\\nPalm 2.3 21.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 2.2 7.0 32\\nWrist Palm\\nLeft Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <2.7 20.1 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.1 10.0 48 >45.0\\nRight Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 15.5 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.0 10.0 50 >45.0\\nLeft Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <3.7 27.1 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 2.5 14.0 56 >45.0\\nRight Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.6 <3.7 28.6 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 0.9 14.0 156 >45.0\\nF Wave Studies\\nECN: 20240220989\\nReceived Date: 2024-02-19Patient: BROWN, KEVIN\\nTest Date: 1/19/2024\\nPage 2\\nNR\\nLeft Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nRight Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nLeft Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nRight Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nEMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Amp Dur Poly Recrt Int Pat Comment\\nRight Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nParaspinal EMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Comment\\nRight C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nRight C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 0\\nFINDINGS: Evaluation of the Left dorsal cutaneous sensory, the Left median (digit 2) sensory, the Right median (digit 2) sensory, the Left radial sensory, and the Right radial sensory nerves showed prolonged distal peak latency (L2.9, L4.2, R4.6, L3.3, R2.9 ms).

Medical treatment for the patient consist of analgesics. The patient was advised to see a Chiropractor and an acupuncturist, advised to attend physical therapy program at a frequency of 4 times per week for the first four weeks, until next evaluation. Physical therapy will consist of various modalities such as thermo therapy (Hot/Cold Pack), electrotherapy and electric stimulation, cervical traction manipulation therapy, assisted active and passive range of motion exercises for injured areas. Additional treatment protocol was outlined with the patient being instructed for specific every day home exercise additional therapeutic equipment such as has been prescribed for patient's home use to support treatment. The patient agreed to therapy plan proposed as recommended. On the basis of medical history presented by the patient and the physical examination findings, it is in my opinion to reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the condition described above is related to the above-mentioned incident. Patient will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks. The possibility of this condition becoming permanent cannot be ruled out at this time because of the severity of the symptoms, the patient is somewhat limited in activities of daily living, as a result of the traumatic injury there were extreme of joint movement with concomitant stretching and tearing of the muscle/ligament structures. It appears that these areas may be permanently weakened for an indefinite period of time resulting in significant and permanent restricted mobility.

LASER DEVICE:\\nLaser Therapy is a recognized treatment that works by increasing circulation to the affected areas through process of photobiomodulation. Multiple studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals on its use in reducing pain, healing chronic wounds and restoring protective sensation. I believe the patient's condition will benefit from use of this laser therapy at home because of musculoskeletal injury treatment and find it medically necessary to control pain, and increase local blood circulation that will assist in rehabilitation. The modality of treatment is cost-effective and appropriate since the patient's symptoms have not improved with other listed interventions. Since this device may be used at home, the patient will be better able to comply with their treatment regimen. The patient will remain in my care while using this device. \\nLumbar Spine\\nPHYSICIAN'S INFORMATION:\\nPhysician Print Name: Jean Pierre Barakat\\nPhysician Address: 6269 99th Street\\nCity: Rego Park State: NY Zip Code: 11374 Phone: 347-578-875\\nNPI #:\\nPhysician's Signature:\\nLicense #:\\nDate: 11/14/22\\nNOTE: Please include all the appropriate Medical Notes with the Prescription \\nECN: 202401020914 Received Date: 2023-12-27 \\nFar Rockaway Medical PC\\n62-69 99th Street, Rego Park, NY 11374 Email: Nyregoparkmedical@gmail.com\\nPatient's Name: Kiwi brown\\nD.O.A. 10/13/23 Date: 11/14/23\\nPOSITIONING CUSHION\\nINFRA RED LAMP\\nGENERAL USE CUSHION (wide)\\nLUMBER SACRAL SUPPORT\\nDEEP TISSUE MASSAGER\\nEMS UNIT FOUR LEAD\\nT.E.N.S.

He has undergone lumbar discectomy with annuloplasty on 12/13/23. He notes complete relief of his radicular symptoms. He notes on and off lumbar axial pain. Currently, he is not suffering any pain. He notes occasional lower thoracic strain/spasticity. He is happy with the outcome. He denies any fever, chills, or signs of infection and any loss of bladder or bowel control. His cervical pain has essentially gone.\\nPhysical Examination:\\nReflexes: All brisk and intact.\\nSensation: Within normal limits.\\nPower Testing: 5/5 for all extremities.\\nCervical Examination: Incision was well healed without signs of infection. No tenderness in the paralumbar region. SLR was negative bilaterally.\\nThoracic Examination: Mild tenderness overlying the perithoracic region of T8 through T12.\\nDiagnostic Impression:\\n1. Lumbar radiculitis with possible radiculopathy status post lumbar disc decompression with annuloplasty. He is having excellent relief. He was given a prescription of Baclofen 20mg p.o. b.i.d. for incidental pain. He requires no specific need for follow up my office.

He was doing well with his lumbosacral pain and radicular symptoms. About 2 weeks ago, spontaneously he started to notice pain going down the right lower extremity. He denies any loss of bladder or bowel control. He rates the pain as about a 6-7/10.\\nPhysical Examination:\\nReflexes: All brisk and intact.\\nSensation: Within normal limits. Radicular pattern of pain is mapped down in the right L5 nerve root distribution.\\nPower Testing: 5/5 for all extremities.\\nCervical Examination: Normal.\\nLumbar Examination: Moderate tenderness overlying the right lumbar facet of L3 through S1. SLR was positive on the right to 60 degrees. Lasegue sign was positive on the right.\\nDiagnostic Impression:\\n1. Lumbar radiculopathy (M54.16). Patient should undergo repeat lumbar epidural steroid injection (62323). If he fails to improve, we may consider obtaining new imaging studies. Hopefully, this is transient radiculitis for the most part, he did well with disc decompression. Hopefully, the patient will do better with an epidural injection. If he fails to improve, consideration for possibility of disc re-herniation and new MRI of the lumbar spine may be considered. For now, we will monitor his progress.\\n2. He may continue Motrin 600mg p.o. t.i.d.

The patient currently rates the pain as 8/10. I will perform second lumbar epidural steroid injection as previously planned. No opioids were given for performance of this procedure. Written informed consent was obtained.\\nThe patient was placed in a prone position prepped and draped using meticulous sterile technique. Using fluoroscopic guidance, L5-S1 interspace was identified. Corresponding skin site was marked, 3cc of 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetizes the skin and subcutaneous tissues using a 25-gauge needle. A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was then advanced using loss of resistance to air technique.\\nOnce encountered, negative aspiration for blood/CSF was performed. No paresthesia was elicited. 1.6cc of Omnipaque 240 revealed good epidural spread followed by 80mg of Kenalog with 3cc of normal saline and 1cc of 1% Lidocaine was administered epidurally. Needle was withdrawn. Sterile Band-Aid was applied.\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was discharged home after PACU discharge criteria were satisfied.\\nSolomon Halioua, M.D.\\nThis has been electronically signed on 03-15-2024.\\nPage 1NEW HORIZON SURGICAL CENTER\\nPatient Name (Last, First): Brown, Kevin\\nPhone # 908-446-4994\\nDate of service: 3/15/24\\nDate of Birth: 7/6/87\\nFUNDED\\nSELF PAY\\nCHARITY\\nCheck Amount:\\nNO-FAULT/PIP\\nState Policy Written: NY/OTHER\\nCase Open: YES NO\\nInsurance Company: Progressive\\nDOA: 12/3/23\\nClaim # 320338745\\nAddress: PO Box 3080\\nClinton, IN 52825\\nAdjuster Name:\\nPh:\\nExt:\\nAttorney Name:\\nPh:\\nAddress:\\nNOTES:\\nWORKERS COMPENSATION\\nState Policy Written: NY/NJ/OTHER\\nCase Open: YES NO\\nInsurance Company:\\nClaim#\\nDOA:\\nWCB#\\nAddress:\\nAdjuster Name:\\nPh:\\nExt:\\nAttorney Name:\\nPh:\\nAddress:\\nNOTES:\\nLIENS /LOPS\\nDOA:\\nAttorney\\'s Name:\\nDo we have signed LOP YES NO (attach if YES)\\nIs this case a slip and fall or MVA related?

Emergency crew did not arrive at the scene of the accident. The patient was not brought to the emergency room. The patient had no medical issues before the accident, as he stated. Past/Family medical history: the patient denies any significant past medical history.\\nSUBJECTIVE COMPLAINTS: The patient reports stiffness and constant aching neck pain (6/10). The patient has difficulties turning the head. The pain exacerbates with increased activity. The patient has stiffness and aching pain in the middle back (6/10). The pain exacerbates by performing house activities, prolonged sitting. The patient also reports constant aching pain in the lower back (7/10). The pain exacerbates by prolonged sitting and standing, bending down.\\nMEDICAL NECESSITY: This report will additionally serve as medical necessity for providing ultrasound testing. A diagnostic ultrasonographic examination was performed in order to help confirm the severity of soft tissue nerve injury and quantify the possibility of a patient’s concomitant neurophysiological status. \\nBenefits of ultrasound:\\n• Dynamic imaging: ultrasound evaluation can be directly guided by the patient’s symptoms and findings at physical examination. This study is concentrated on the area of the concern of the patient, areas of tenderness and focal symptoms with feedback from the patient during exam. Doctors can diagnose “in real time” as they can see movement of a soft tissue structure such as tendon, joint or an extremity.\\n• Sensitivity: ultrasound is priceless in the assessing of the conditions, such as partial or full-thickness tears of muscles or ligaments, hemorrhages, snap tendon syndromes, bone injury’s, infections, blood accumulations, cellulitis, detection of soft tissue masses, ganglion cysts, soft tissues tumors. According to a Mayo clinic study, ultrasound appeared to be more sensitive than MRI in detecting injuries in the inflammation of certain structures as well as stages of healing: from active inflammation to resolved condition, such as resolved stage of healing fibrosis.\\n• Availability: widely available, easy-to-use and less expensive than most other imaging methods.\\n• Safety: extremely safe, non-invasive and does not use radiation, excellent alternative for claustrophobic patients and patients with cardiac pacemakers or metallic implants. Ultrasound has no known harmful effects on humans. \\nUltrasound is sophisticated, quick, and efficient diagnostic procedure not only for making exact diagnosis but also for establishing stage of healing which is helping in the modification of the treatment process in a timely manner.\\nTIME OF PROCEDURE: 30 minutes. \\nSKILLS OF THE DOCTOR: Procedure is performed and interpreted by Chiropractor duly licensed in the state of New York who specializes in the Diagnostic Sonography and has multiple certifications from Sonogram schools.

No cystic lesions nor muscle tears were noted.\\nIMPRESSION: There is an abnormal echogenicity of the bilateral paraspinal muscles of the lumbar, cervical, thoracic spine, and left paraspinal muscles of sacroiliac spine, which may be due to muscle spasms, inflammation, trauma, strain, as muscle guarding/chronic facet subluxation, Spinal misalignment or developing of fibrotic changes as well as muscle spasm. No cystic lesions nor muscle tears were noted. Mild improvement was demonstrated at the lumbar and sacroiliac spine, with slightly decreased level of inflammation and partially diminished area of muscle spasm. Fibrous tissue noted. Same level of inflammation was demonstrated at the cervical and thoracic spine, with remaining abnormal echogenicity of paraspinal muscles.\\nWe compared this study with previous studies of 12/04/2023.

Phys:\\nMEDICAL NECESSITY: The patient's symptoms and neurological signs raise the possibility of the peripheral nervous system (nerve root, peripheral nerve) injury (irritation, compression, stretching). Neurophysiologic testing is intended to clarify this clinical suspicion and differentiate spinal nerve root lesion from peripheral nerve lesion. Abnormal NCV & EMG correlate with less favorable prognosis of recovery and are helpful in further clinical management. If there is diffuse denervation, prognosis of functional recovery is unfavorable. But if there are no signs of denervation, the prognosis is more favorable.\\nNerve Conduction Studies\\nMotor Summary Table\\nLeft Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 5.2 28.0 54 >50.0\\nElbow 9.1 7.5 >5.0\\nRight Median Motor (Abd Poll Brev)\\nWrist 3.9 <4.2 8.6 >5.0 Elbow Wrist 4.7 28.0 60 >50.0\\nElbow 8.6 8.7 >5.0\\nLeft Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 2.8 <4.2 9.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.9 26.0 53 >53.0\\nElbow 7.7 9.4 >3.0\\nRight Ulnar Motor (Abd Dig Minimi)\\nWrist 3.0 <4.2 7.9 >3.0 Elbow Wrist 4.2 26.0 62 >53.0\\nElbow 7.2 4.8 >3.0\\nSensory Summary Table\\nLeft DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 13.1 >10.0 Wrist Dorsum 5th MC 2.0 12.0 60 >45.0\\nRight DorsCutan Sensory (Dorsum 5th MC)\\nWrist <2.7 12.0 >45.0\\nLeft Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.2 <3.6 38.1 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 3.3 14.0 42 >39.0\\nPalm 2.1 33.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 0.9 7.0 78\\nWrist 2nd Digit 2.4 7.0 29\\nPalm 2nd Digit 3.6 14.0 39\\nRight Median D2 Sensory (2nd Digit)\\nWrist 4.6 <3.6 30.0 >10.0 Wrist 2nd Digit 1.4 7.0 50 >39.0\\nPalm 2.3 21.8 >10.0 Palm 2nd Digit 2.2 7.0 32\\nWrist Palm\\nLeft Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <2.7 20.1 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.1 10.0 48 >45.0\\nRight Radial Sensory (Base 1st Digit)\\nWrist 2.9 <2.7 15.5 >10.0 Wrist Base 1st Digit 2.0 10.0 50 >45.0\\nLeft Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.3 <3.7 27.1 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 2.5 14.0 56 >45.0\\nRight Ulnar Sensory (5th Digit)\\nWrist 3.6 <3.7 28.6 >15.0 Wrist 5th Digit 0.9 14.0 156 >45.0\\nF Wave Studies\\nECN: 20240220989\\nReceived Date: 2024-02-19Patient: BROWN, KEVIN\\nTest Date: 1/19/2024\\nPage 2\\nNR\\nLeft Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nRight Median (Mrkrs) (Abd Poll Brev) 20.00 <33\\nLeft Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nRight Ulnar (Mrkrs) (Abd Dig Min) 25.28 <36\\nEMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Amp Dur Poly Recrt Int Pat Comment\\nRight Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nRight FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Biceps Musculocut C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Triceps Radial C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft Deltoid Axillary C5-6 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nLeft FlexCarRad Median C6-7 Nml 0 0 0 Nml Nml 0 Nml Complete\\nParaspinal EMG\\nSide Muscle Nerve Root Ins Act Fibs Psw Comment\\nRight C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nRight C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nRight C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C3-4 Parasp Rami C3-4 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C4-5 Parasp Rami C4-5 Nml 0 0 1+\\nLeft C5-6 Parasp Rami C5-6 Nml 0 0 0\\nLeft C6-7 Parasp Rami C6-7 Nml 0 0 0\\nFINDINGS: Evaluation of the Left dorsal cutaneous sensory, the Left median (digit 2) sensory, the Right median (digit 2) sensory, the Left radial sensory, and the Right radial sensory nerves showed prolonged distal peak latency (L2.9, L4.2, R4.6, L3.3, R2.9 ms).

Medical treatment for the patient consist of analgesics. The patient was advised to see a Chiropractor and an acupuncturist, advised to attend physical therapy program at a frequency of 4 times per week for the first four weeks, until next evaluation. Physical therapy will consist of various modalities such as thermo therapy (Hot/Cold Pack), electrotherapy and electric stimulation, cervical traction manipulation therapy, assisted active and passive range of motion exercises for injured areas. Additional treatment protocol was outlined with the patient being instructed for specific every day home exercise additional therapeutic equipment such as has been prescribed for patient's home use to support treatment. The patient agreed to therapy plan proposed as recommended. On the basis of medical history presented by the patient and the physical examination findings, it is in my opinion to reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the condition described above is related to the above-mentioned incident. Patient will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks. The possibility of this condition becoming permanent cannot be ruled out at this time because of the severity of the symptoms, the patient is somewhat limited in activities of daily living, as a result of the traumatic injury there were extreme of joint movement with concomitant stretching and tearing of the muscle/ligament structures. It appears that these areas may be permanently weakened for an indefinite period of time resulting in significant and permanent restricted mobility.

The patient agreed to therapy plan proposed as recommended.\\nCASUALTY\\nOn the basis of medical history presented by the patient and the physical examination findings, it is in my opinion to reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the condition described above is related to the above-mentioned incident. \\nPatient will be re-evaluated in 8 weeks.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nThe possibility of this condition becoming permanent cannot be ruled out at this time because of the severity of the symptoms, the patient is somewhat limited in activities of daily living, as a result of the traumatic injury there were extreme of joint movement with concomitant stretching and tearing of the musculo-ligament structures of. \\nIt appears that these areas may be permanently weakened for an indefinite period of time resulting in significant and permanent restricted mobility.\\nRespectfully Submitted,\\nJean-Pierre Georges Barakat, MD \\nInternal Medicine\\nDOCTOR'S NOTES AND COMMENTS\\nRIGHT FRONT BACK LEFT\\n8\\nECN: 2023120104570 Received Date: 2023-12-01Pain\\nBurning\\nCramping\\nWeakness\\nPins/Needles\\nDizziness\\nPatient Kevin Brown\\nDate 12/16/23\\nECN: 2023120104570\\nReceived Date: 2023-12-01 \\nCERVICALGIA\\nSPRAIN OF LIGAMENTS OF C/S IE\\nSPRAIN OF JOINTS & LIGAMENTS OF OTHER PARTS OF,NECK, IE\\nSTRAIN OF MUSCLE, FASCIA AND TENDON AT NECK LEVEL, IE\\nRADICULOPATHY, OCCIPITO-ATLANTO-AXIAL REGION\\nRADICULOPATHY, CERVICAL REGION\\nRADICULOPATHY, CERVICOTHORACIC REGION\\nOTHER CERVICAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, UNSP, CERVICAL REG.\\nOTHER CERVICAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, HIGH CERVICAL REGION\\nOTHER CERVICAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, MID-CERVICAL REGION\\nOTHER CERVICAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, CERVICOTHORACIC\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF CERVICAL REGION\\nMYALGIA\\nPAIN IN RIGHT HIP\\nPAIN IN LEFT HIP\\nUNSPECIFIED SPRAIN OF RIGHT HIP, IE\\nUNSPECIFIED SPRAIN OF LEFT HIP, IE\\nPAIN IN RIGHT KNEE\\nPAIN IN LEFT KNEE\\nPAIN OF UNSPECIFIED SITE OF WRIST\\nPAIN OF UNSPECIFIED SITE OF HAND\\nCONTUSION OF RIGHT KNEE, IE\\nCONTUSION OF LEFT KNEE, IE\\nSPRAIN OF UNSPECIFIED LIGAMENT OF RIGHT ANKLE/FOOT\\nSPRAIN OF UNSPECIFIED LIGAMENT OF LEFT ANKLE/FOOT\\nPAIN IN RIGHT ANKLE & JOINTS OF RIGHT FOOT\\nPAIN IN LEFT ANKLE & JOINTS OF LEFT FOOT\\nUNSPECIFIED SPRAIN OF RIGHT SHOULDER, IE\\nUNSPECIFIED SPRAIN OF LEFT SHOULDER, IE\\nPAIN, RIGHT SHOULDER\\nPAIN, LEFT SHOULDER\\nSTRAIN/TEAR OF MUSCLE AND TENDON, ROTATOR CUFF, RIGHT\\nSTRAIN/TEAR OF MUSCLE AND TENDON, ROTATOR CUFF, LEFT\\nCONTUSION OF RIGHT SHOULDER, IE\\nCONTUSION OF LEFT SHOULDER, IE\\nTHORACIC SPINE DX\\nPAIN IN THORACIC SPINE\\nSPRAIN OF LIGAMENTS OF THORACIC SPINE IE\\nSPRAIN OF OTHER SPECIFIED PARTS OF THORAX, IE\\nINTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISORDER WITH RADIC, THORACIC REG\\nINTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISORDER WITH RADIC, THORACOLUMBAR\\nRADICULOPATHY, THORACIC REGION\\nRADICULOPATHY, THORACOLUMBAR REGION\\nOTHER INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, THORACIC REG\\nOTHER INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, THORACOLUMBAR\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF THORACIC REGION\\nLUMBAR-LUMBOSACRAL DX\\nLOW BACK PAIN\\nSPRAIN OF LIGAMENTS OF LUMBAR SPINE, IE\\nSPRAIN OF UNSPECIFIED PARTS OF LUMBAR SPINE & PELVIS, IE\\nINTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISORDER WITH RADIC, LUMBAR REG\\nINTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISORDER WITH RADIC, LUMBOSACRAL\\nRADICULOPATHY, LUMBAR REGION\\nRADICULOPATHY, LUMBOSACRAL REGION\\nOTHER INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, LUMBAR REG\\nOTHER INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISPLACEMENT, LUMBOSACRAL\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF LUMBAR REGION\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF SACRAL REGION\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF PELVIC REGION\\nWRISTS\\nUNSPECIFIED SPRAIN OF RIGHT WRIST\\nUNSPECIFIED SPRAIN OF LEFT WRIST\\nPAIN IN RIGHT FOREARM\\nPAIN IN LEFT FOREARM\\nPAIN IN RIGHT HAND\\nPAIN IN LEFT HAND\\nMUSCLE SPASM OF BACK\\nMUSCLE WEAKNESS\\nMYALGIA\\nDIZZINESS\\nNERVOUSNESS\\nHEADACHE (UNSPECIFIED)\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF HEAD\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF CERVICAL REGION\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF THORACIC REGION\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF LUMBAR REGION\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF SACRAL REGION\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF PELVIC REGION\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF LOWER EXTREMITY\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF UPPER EXTREMITY\\nSEGMENTAL & SOMATIC DYSFUNCTION OF RIBS\\nECN: 2023120104570\\nReceived Date: 2023-12-01Far Rockaway Medical PC\\n62-69 99th Street, Rego Park, NY 11374, Email.

LASER DEVICE:\\nLaser Therapy is a recognized treatment that works by increasing circulation to the affected areas through process of photobiomodulation. Multiple studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals on its use in reducing pain, healing chronic wounds and restoring protective sensation. I believe the patient's condition will benefit from use of this laser therapy at home because of musculoskeletal injury treatment and find it medically necessary to control pain, and increase local blood circulation that will assist in rehabilitation.

Radicular pattern of pain is mapped down in the right L5 nerve root distribution.\\nPower Testing: 5/5 for all extremities.\\nCervical Examination: Normal.\\nLumbar Examination: Moderate tenderness overlying the right lumbar facet of L3 through S1. SLR was positive on the right to 60 degrees. Lasegue sign was positive on the right.\\nDiagnostic Impression:\\n1. Lumbar radiculopathy (M54.16). Patient should undergo repeat lumbar epidural steroid injection (62323). If he fails to improve, we may consider obtaining new imaging studies. Hopefully, this is transient radiculitis for the most part, he did well with disc decompression. Hopefully, the patient will do better with an epidural injection. If he fails to improve, consideration for possibility of disc re-herniation and new MRI of the lumbar spine may be considered. For now, we will monitor his progress.\\n2. He may continue Motrin 600mg p.o. t.i.d. I have given him a prescription for Baclofen 10mg p.o. b.i.d., 40.\\nRespectfully Submitted,\\nSolomon Halioua, M.D.\\nThis has been electronically signed by Solomon Halioua, M.D. for visit dated 03-12-2024.\\nPage 1BROWN, KEVIN Male 07-06-1987\\nNew Horizon Surgical Center, L.L.C.\\n680 Broadway, Suite 201\\nPaterson, NJ 07514\\nTel:(973)782-4202 Fax:(973)782-4206\\nDATE: 03-15-2024\\nPATIENT: KEVIN BROWN\\nCHART NO: SCL11793\\nMRN: 71066\\nD.O.B: 07-06-1987\\nAGE: 36 year\\nRECORD OF OPERATION\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lumbar radiculopathy\\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lumbar radiculopathy\\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1.

The patient currently rates the pain as 8/10. I will perform second lumbar epidural steroid injection as previously planned. No opioids were given for performance of this procedure. Written informed consent was obtained.\\nThe patient was placed in a prone position prepped and draped using meticulous sterile technique. Using fluoroscopic guidance, L5-S1 interspace was identified. Corresponding skin site was marked, 3cc of 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetizes the skin and subcutaneous tissues using a 25-gauge needle. A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was then advanced using loss of resistance to air technique.\\nOnce encountered, negative aspiration for blood/CSF was performed. No paresthesia was elicited. 1.6cc of Omnipaque 240 revealed good epidural spread followed by 80mg of Kenalog with 3cc of normal saline and 1cc of 1% Lidocaine was administered epidurally. Needle was withdrawn. Sterile Band-Aid was applied.\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was discharged home after PACU discharge criteria were satisfied.\\nSolomon Halioua, M.D.\\nThis has been electronically signed on 03-15-2024.\\nPage 1NEW HORIZON SURGICAL CENTER\\nPatient Name (Last, First): Brown, Kevin\\nPhone # 908-446-4994\\nDate of service: 3/15/24\\nDate of Birth: 7/6/87\\nFUNDED\\nSELF PAY\\nCHARITY\\nCheck Amount:\\nNO-FAULT/PIP\\nState Policy Written: NY/OTHER\\nCase Open: YES NO\\nInsurance Company: Progressive\\nDOA: 12/3/23\\nClaim # 320338745\\nAddress: PO Box 3080\\nClinton, IN 52825\\nAdjuster Name:\\nPh:\\nExt:\\nAttorney Name:\\nPh:\\nAddress:\\nNOTES:\\nWORKERS COMPENSATION\\nState Policy Written: NY/NJ/OTHER\\nCase Open: YES NO\\nInsurance Company:\\nClaim#\\nDOA:\\nWCB#\\nAddress:\\nAdjuster Name:\\nPh:\\nExt:\\nAttorney Name:\\nPh:\\nAddress:\\nNOTES:\\nLIENS /LOPS\\nDOA:\\nAttorney\\'s Name:\\nDo we have signed LOP YES NO (attach if YES)\\nIs this case a slip and fall or MVA related?

Past/Family medical history: the patient denies any significant past medical history.\\nSUBJECTIVE COMPLAINTS: The patient reports stiffness and constant aching neck pain (6/10). The patient has difficulties turning the head. The pain exacerbates with increased activity. The patient has stiffness and aching pain in the middle back (6/10). The pain exacerbates by performing house activities, prolonged sitting. The patient also reports constant aching pain in the lower back (7/10). The pain exacerbates by prolonged sitting and standing, bending down.\\nMEDICAL NECESSITY: This report will additionally serve as medical necessity for providing ultrasound testing. A diagnostic ultrasonographic examination was performed in order to help confirm the severity of soft tissue nerve injury and quantify the possibility of a patient’s concomitant neurophysiological status. \\nBenefits of ultrasound:\\n• Dynamic imaging: ultrasound evaluation can be directly guided by the patient’s symptoms and findings at physical examination. This study is concentrated on the area of the concern of the patient, areas of tenderness and focal symptoms with feedback from the patient during exam. Doctors can diagnose “in real time” as they can see movement of a soft tissue structure such as tendon, joint or an extremity.\\n• Sensitivity: ultrasound is priceless in the assessing of the conditions, such as partial or full-thickness tears of muscles or ligaments, hemorrhages, snap tendon syndromes, bone injury’s, infections, blood accumulations, cellulitis, detection of soft tissue masses, ganglion cysts, soft tissues tumors. According to a Mayo clinic study, ultrasound appeared to be more sensitive than MRI in detecting injuries in the inflammation of certain structures as well as stages of healing: from active inflammation to resolved condition, such as resolved stage of healing fibrosis.\\n• Availability: widely available, easy-to-use and less expensive than most other imaging methods.\\n• Safety: extremely safe, non-invasive and does not use radiation, excellent alternative for claustrophobic patients and patients with cardiac pacemakers or metallic implants. Ultrasound has no known harmful effects on humans. \\nUltrasound is sophisticated, quick, and efficient diagnostic procedure not only for making exact diagnosis but also for establishing stage of healing which is helping in the modification of the treatment process in a timely manner.\\nTIME OF PROCEDURE: 30 minutes. \\nSKILLS OF THE DOCTOR: Procedure is performed and interpreted by Chiropractor duly licensed in the state of New York who specializes in the Diagnostic Sonography and has multiple certifications from Sonogram schools.
