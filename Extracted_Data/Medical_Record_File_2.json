The claimant presented a Driver's License for verification. The examination was performed in the presence of a medical assistant, Amanjot. Mr. Dillard drove himself to our office. There was no interpreter present at the time of the IME.\nThe findings of my examination are as follows:\nINJURY HISTORY:\nMr. Bayani Dillard is a 46-year-old right-handed male, who alleges that he sustained injuries to the right knee as a result of a work-related accident on 6/11/2021. At the time of the incident, Mr. Dillard was employed as an EMT. He states that on the day of the incident while jumping off the EMS vehicle, he mis stepped and landed awkwardly on his right knee which caused severe pain. \nMr. Dillard went to the emergency room at Flushing Hospital immediately after the incident. X-rays and CT scans of the right knee were performed. Later that day, he was treated with medications for pain relief and was released home.\nAfter the injury, the claimant followed up with an orthopedic surgeon and a pain management specialist. He reports that he was advised to start with physical therapy. Mr. Dillard has undergone further diagnostic testing with X-rays and MRIs of the right knee. Mr. Dillard denies receiving any injections. He underwent right knee arthroscopy on 1/10/2022. The claimant has no current treatment in place.\nPRESENT COMPLAINTS:\nToday, Mr. Dillard described pain in the right knee. \n",

The underlying diagnosis is that of multicompartmental arthritis of the knee.\nCAUSALITY:\nAfter reviewing the medical records, taking a history, and performing a physical examination, there is a causal relationship between the knee strain and the date of loss/injury. The multicompartmental arthritis of the knee is pre-existing.\nMMI:\nBased on the findings of my examination today, in my opinion, the claimant has attained maximum medical improvement.\nSLU:\nBased on today's examination, the claimant has a 26% scheduled loss of use of the Right knee (with 26% for defect of flexion and 0% for defect of extension). The SLU is calculated with the contralateral knee as a baseline. Reference chapter 7, page 42, table 7.4. Workers' Compensation Guidelines for Determining Impairment First Edition, November 22, 2017.\nHowever it should be noted that the SLU is influenced by underlying osteoarthritis. This does not depict the claimant's clinical status.\nTREATMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\nBased upon evaluation as well as a review of medical records, the claimant would not benefit from additional medical treatment, physical therapy, diagnostic testing, evaluations, or surgery. There is no need for further treatment at this time. A self-directed home exercise program is reasonable at this stage.\nThe past treatment was reasonable, related, and necessary.\nPROGNOSIS: \n",

Sometimes, knee pain is sudden (acute) and may be caused by damage, swelling, or irritation of the muscles and tissues that support your knee.\nThe pain often goes away on its own with time and rest. If the pain does not go away, tests may be done to find out what is causing the pain. \nFollow these instructions at home:\nPay attention to any changes in your symptoms. Take these actions to relieve your pain.\nIf you have a knee sleeve or brace:\n* Wear the sleeve or brace as told by your doctor. Remove it only as told by your doctor.\n* Loosen the sleeve or brace if your toes:\n - Tingle.\n - Become numb.\n - Turn cold and blue.\n* Keep the sleeve or brace clean.\n* If the sleeve or brace is not waterproof:\n - Do not let it get wet.\n - Cover it with a watertight covering when you take a bath or shower.\nActivity\n* Rest your knee.\n* Do not do things that cause pain.\n* Avoid activities where both feet leave the ground at the same time (high-impact activities). Examples are running, jumping rope, and doing jumping jacks.\n* Work with a physical therapist to make a safe exercise program, as told by your doctor.\nManaging pain, stiffness, and swelling\nBayani Dillard (MRN: 661237) - Printed by Jeannine Brady, RN at 6/11/21 8:44 PM Page 4 of 6\nPrinted on 6/12/23 3:26 PM",

Compression may be done with an elastic bandage.\nGeneral instructions\n- Take all medicines only as told by your doctor.\n- Raise (elevate) your knee while you are sitting or lying down. Make sure your knee is higher than your heart.\n- Sleep with a pillow under your knee.\n- Do not use any products that contain nicotine or tobacco. These include cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and chewing tobacco. These products may slow down healing. If you need help quitting, ask your doctor.\n- If you are overweight, work with your doctor and a food expert (dietitian) to set goals to lose weight. Being overweight can make your knee hurt more.\n- Keep all follow-up visits as told by your doctor.

PC\nInsurance: WCOFFICE\nPhysician: Gus Katslgiorgis, DO\nGender: MALE\nPhone: (917)388-5380\nHistory of Present Illness\nThe patient presents for evaluation. He works as an EMS worker. While performing his work activities he was in McDonald's bathroom, slipped on the floor landing on his right knee. He states there was water/urine on the floor, causing him to fall, twisting his knee and shoulder and landed on the right knee. Denies any prior injuries or problems before to the right knee. He is 44 years of age. Hes is not working now because of his injury. He went to Flushing hospital and then saw a Dr. Guillaume about the right knee with clicking, popping, swelling, giving way sensations. \nPast Medical History: Asthma, High blood pressure.\nNo Known Drug Allergies\nPhysical Exam\nNote: Examination of the Right Knee: There is patellofemoral pain. There is tenderness. Positive McMurray's sign. Swelling/Effusion. Neurovascularly intact. Restricted range of motion five degrees shy of full extension, 100 degrees of flexion.\nX-RAYS\nX-rays of the Right Knee/ 3 views: Degenerative changes present. Reveal no fractures. \nAssessment\nRight knee meniscus tear. Mechanical symptoms.\nOther tear of medial meniscus, current injury, right knee, initial encounter (S83.241A)\nEncounter for examination and observation following work accident (Z04.2)\nPlan\nPhysical therapy. I went over risks, benefits and alternatives of right knee arthroscopy with possible arthrotomy, possible meniscectomy, possible meniscal repair with the patient. I discussed if meniscal repair is carried out, the patient may need further surgery with regards to meniscectomy if the meniscus does not heal. I discussed if partial meniscectomy is performed, that only the damaged portion of the meniscus will be removed. I discussed possible complications including, but not limited to, infection, bleeding, nerve damage, stiffness, pain, implant loosening, hardware loosening, skin breakdown, keloid formation, neuroma formation and further surgery for this, post-operative RSD, post-operative DVT, PE, MI, possible loss of limb or life, persistence of symptoms and possible need for further surgery in the future. No guarantees were made. All questions were answered. The patient does want to proceed with surgery. I am requesting authorization for right knee arthroscopy, possible arthrotomy, possible meniscectomy, possible meniscal repair.\nIn my opinion the incident that the patient describes is the competent medical cause of this injury. \nThe patients complaints are consistent with their history of injury.\nThe patients history of illness is consistent with my objective findings.\nThe patient has a 100% temporary impairment. \nPage 1/2",

Cold and compression is necessary for post-operative care, the Vascutherm Unit will help the patient symptomatically as well as help decrease swelling to the area. The pain will be decreased from the usage of the Vascutherm Unit and the patient will be less inclined to need stronger pain medication. \nSCDs is to prevent blood clots as the patient will be mostly immobilized from s/p surgery. Without any type of immobilization patient is at a greater risk of DVT development, especially with a combination of any type of underlying medical condition. SCDs will promote circulation while the patient is immobilized and will prevent any blood clots which could be very dangerous and life threatening.\nSincerely,\nDr. Gus KatsigiorgisDO \n",

One arthroscopic portal was made lateral to the suprapatellar tendon to enter the joint space. The arthroscope was introduced in the suprapatellar region. Synovitis was present. No patellar maltracking was present. Chondromalacia was noted about the undersurface of the patella, about the femoral trochlea, grade 3. The lateral gutter was inspected, no pathology of the lateral gutter. The medial gutter was inspected, no pathology of the medial gutter. A medial arthroscopic portal was made under direct visualization to avoid injury to medial meniscus. Probing of the medial meniscus was performed. Complex tearing of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus extending into the body, nonrepairable was noted. Chondromalacia was noted about the medial femoral condyle, medial tibial plateau grade 3. Chondroplasty was performed. Synovitis was noted. Synovectomy was performed. Using arthroscopic duckbill and shaving instruments, partial medial meniscectomy was performed to a smooth, stable contour. Further probing of the medial meniscus revealed no further tears and the meniscus was noted to be stable. The intercondylar notch was inspected. Synovitis was noted. Synovectomy was performed. The lateral joint space was inspected. Synovitis was noted. Synovectomy was performed. No lateral meniscus tear was present.

Patient suffers from right knee derangement.\nPast medical history: Obesity, Sleep Apnea\nMedication: None\nPhysical examination of the right knee shows tenderness to palpation. ROM shows limitation.\nAssessment:\nRight Knee Derangement\nTreatment plan:\nWe discussed again the option of conservative treatment alone versus conservative treatment with an injection of steroids in the right knee.\nRisks, benefits and side effects were detailed including but not limited to risk of local and general reaction to the products along with remote occurrence of vasovagal reaction, risk of infection, risk of pain and discomfort in the site of injection as well as medical and metabolic risks associated with patient with comorbidities.\nPatient decided to move forward and will receive this injection.

Patient was placed in the supine position and the site of procedure was exposed. The area was properly prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion using Betadine. A local spray anesthetic agent of Lithyl Chloride was used to ease the discomfort felt with penetration of the needle. The area of injection anatomically is located in right knee suprapatellar pouch using a lateral approach.\nUltrasound image was used to confirm the site of injection and placement of the needle. An 18\" gauge needle was introduced in the site with intermittent ultrasound image to verify proper placement of the needle in the right knee joint. 40cc yellowish fluid were aspirated from the knee and then 40mg Depomedrol mixed with 3cc Lidocaine were injected in the right knee. Patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications noted.\nBlood pressure remained within normal limits before, during, after the procedure. He was instructed to apply local ice compress over the injection site for 20 minutes every 6 hours for the next 24 hours and will avoid physical therapy and straining. Patient instructed to contact us at NYMDC if there is any exacerbation of symptoms. A post procedure sheet was provided. Patient instructed to follow up 2-3 weeks at which point further recommendation options will be discussed.\nEnd of note.

Under this program, an employer or its insurance carrier begins making payments to you in order to provide you with temporary funds, while still investigating the circumstances of the reported accident or injury, including an investigation as to whether it is the correct employer or its insurance carrier. You should have received a notice from the employer or carrier indicating that payments have begun. The reason that you are receiving payments should be identified on the notice you received from the employer or insurance carrier. Contact your employer or its insurance carrier, if you have not received this notice. If you have not started to receive payments, contact the nearest office of the Workers' Compensation Board immediately. \nIf the employer or insurance carrier is still investigating the circumstances of the reported accident or injury, payments are made pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law 21-a. The payment of temporary compensation is not an admission by the employer that it is liable for your injury or injuries. Your acceptance of temporary payments will not prejudice your claim for further benefits. Your employer may request that you enter into an agreement in order to ensure the continuation of payments of temporary compensation. Temporary compensation and prescribed medical payments may continue for up to one year from the date of first payment, or until your employer contests your right to compensation, or until the Board's determination of your claim, whichever is first. Your employer may stop temporary payments at any time provided it sends you a notice of termination of temporary payments within five days after the last payment is made. If your employer stops temporary payments, it will notify you in writing whether or not it is contesting your claim. (Contact the Board immediately if your payments stop and you do not receive a written notice from the employer.) The Board will then notify you of any further action taken in your case. If your employer does not send you a notice of termination of temporary benefits within one year after the start of payments, your employer will be considered to have admitted liability for your claim.\nSR3 (1-14) Page 4 of 4 www.wcb.ny.gov 236 \n",
