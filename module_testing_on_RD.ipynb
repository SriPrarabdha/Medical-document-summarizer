The treatment plan includes bed rest, avoiding physical activity, and attending supervised physical therapy on a regular basis, with the frequency to be determined. The patient reported decreased muscle stiffness and pain following the procedure. The prognosis for recovery is cautiously optimistic, and the disability resulting from the injuries sustained in the accident may be of a temporary or permanent nature.
